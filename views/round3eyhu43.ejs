    <p>It's Sherlock's Birthday!! And there is a round cake with nine candles stuck in it,
      arranged in a circle along the edges. The candles are magical and Watson has given
      Sherlock the challenge to blow all the candles. But there is a catch!! Once he blow
      out one candle, the adjacent candles will also be extinguished. If he blow on an
      extinguished candle, it will reignite, and also change the state of its adjacent candles.
      Basically when he blow on a candle, it - as well as the candles on either side - will go
      from lit to unlit, and vice versa. Since Sherlock is the laziest person in the world. He
      wants to reduce the effort. What are the minimum number of blows he can go about
      extinguishing all of the candles??</p>

      <p>Greg tells Sherlock that he has three children. The product of his children's
        age is 72 and the sum of their ages is the house number. Sherlock tries to deduce their ages.
        Then Greg says, "oh, my oldest child loves chocolate chip cookies". Sherlock then
        figures it out, What is the square of the oldest child's age?<br>

              <pre> Sherlock being a detective has a lot of connections or you can say street detectives. Sherlock
needs their help to find the details about a person or an event and he pay them accordingly.
But the gang is full of notorious kids. To get anything done from them is a herculean task.
Sherlock wanted to depict a crime scene. He gave this reponsibility to Bill Wiggins. Wiggins
did an excellent job of depiction of crime scene. As a reward , Sherlock gave him money
and a sequence of numbers to play with as he loves Maths. But Wiggins likes playing with
"interesting" sequence of numbers, which are sequences that have equal elements.
Now, the problem is - Sherlock has sequence of elements, and that sequence isn't always
"interesting". To ensure sequence has equal elements, Sherlock has 2 options:
1) Choose 	two elements of sequence. DECREASE the first element by 1 and INCREASE
the second element by 1. This operation costs 'K' coins, where 'K' is the output of Riddle 1.
2) Choose one element of array and INCREASE it by 1. This operation costs 'L'coins, where
'L' is the output of 2nd riddle.
What's the minimum no. of coins Sherlock needs to turn his sequence into a "interesting"
sequence for Wiggins?
Sequence of elements-> 53 52 83 38 46 96 2 36 100 28 6 75 79 34 58 40 56 23 70 68</pre>
